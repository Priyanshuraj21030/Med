        Since benign tumors are harmless, doctors may opt to leave the lump
        alone rather than remove it. If you are experiencing discomfort,
        irritation or pressure, let your doctor know so that she can plan to
        remove it for you and improve your comfort.

      <p class="lead mb-0">
        Malignant tumors are cancerous and aggressive because they invade and
        damage surrounding tissue. When a tumor is suspected to be malignant,
        the doctor will perform a biopsy to determine the severity or
        aggressiveness of the tumor.
